The purpose of erc, the "effortless Reddit curator," is to effortlessly create video montages of Reddit threads.

erc functions as a pipeline, starting with the URL to a thread the user likes, and ending with a complete video of the top comments, dubbed over by a text-to-speech bot.

These videos can then be uploaded to YouTube or any other video sharing platform for others' enjoyment.
